# gana

gana is a special small library for generifying golang code. Written in close 
collaboration with [Matthew Sanetra](https://github.com/matthewsanetra).

## Installation

```bash
go get github.com/thecsw/gana
```

## Usage

See generic functions included in the library in [ops.go](ops.go).

Set operations included in [set.go](set.go).

Tuple operations included in [tuple.go](tuple.go).

String operations included in [string.go](string.go).

Workers included in [worker.go](worker.go). But I recommend using
[komi](https://github.com/thecsw/komi) instead.

Lazy operations included in [lazy](lazy).
